# Work-Day-Planner

## Function
I am using a daily planner to create a schedule and when I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
WHEN I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
WHEN I click into a timeblock, then I can enter an event
